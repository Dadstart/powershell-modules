    .SYNOPSIS
        Orchestrates a complete DVD processing workflow with automated directory structure creation and content organization.
    .DESCRIPTION
        Invoke-DvdProcessing serves as the main entry point for DVD processing workflows, providing:
        - Automated creation of organized directory structures for content processing
        - Integration with TVDb for metadata retrieval and episode information
        - Chapter and caption extraction from DVD sources
        - Setup of processing stage directories (HandBrake, Remux, Topaz, Bonus)
        - Content organization by season with proper naming conventions
        - Integration with the refactored DVD module functions for optimal performance
        This function leverages the refactored DVD module architecture, which includes:
        - Centralized audio stream processing via Get-FilteredAudioStreams
        - Automated temporary directory management via Use-TempDirectory
        - Standardized HandBrake options generation via Get-HandbrakeOptions
        The workflow ensures all necessary directories and extracted content are properly
        organized for subsequent processing steps using the optimized module functions.
    .PARAMETER Title
        The title of the DVD content to process. Used to create the root directory structure
        and organize content. Should be a descriptive name that identifies the content.
        Examples: "Breaking Bad", "The Office", "The Matrix", "Game of Thrones"
    .PARAMETER Path
        The source directories containing the DVD content files. Can be a single path or multiple
        comma-separated paths. These directories should contain the original DVD files.
        Supported formats: VOB (DVD), M2TS (Blu-ray), MKV (already-ripped content)
        Examples: "D:\DVD1", "D:\DVD1,D:\DVD2", "C:\Rips\Season1"
    .PARAMETER FilePatterns
        Array of file patterns to match for processing. Multiple patterns can be specified
        to handle different file types in the same workflow.
        Common patterns:
        - "*.vob" - DVD video files
        - "*.m2ts" - Blu-ray video files  
        - "*.mkv" - Already-ripped content
        - "C4_*" - DVD rips with specific naming
        - "B3_*" - Blu-ray rips with specific naming
    .PARAMETER Season
        The season number for the content. Used to create season-specific directories
        and organize content properly. Should be a number that corresponds to the actual
        season of the content.
        Examples: 1, 2, 5, 10
    .PARAMETER TvDbSeriesUrl
        The TVDb series URL for metadata retrieval. This URL is used to fetch episode
        information, titles, and other metadata throughout the processing workflow.
        Format: "https://thetvdb.com/series/show-name"
        Examples:
        - "https://thetvdb.com/series/breaking-bad"
        - "https://thetvdb.com/series/the-office-us"
        - "https://thetvdb.com/series/game-of-thrones"
    .PARAMETER SkipChapterExtraction
        When specified, skips the chapter extraction phase. Useful when you only want
        to copy files and extract captions without creating sample chapter clips.
        Default behavior (when not specified) is to extract chapter samples.
    .PARAMETER SkipCaptionExtraction
        When specified, skips the caption extraction phase. Useful when you only want
        to copy files and extract chapters without processing subtitle files.
        Default behavior (when not specified) is to extract captions.
    .PARAMETER ChapterDirectory
        Directory name for storing extracted chapter clips and sample content. Default is "chapters".
        This directory will contain short clips extracted from $ChapterNumber chapters of the content for preview
        or testing purposes.
        The actual path will be: ./Title/Season XX/chapters/
    .PARAMETER ChapterNumber
        The chapter number to extract for sample clips. Default is 3. This parameter
        determines which chapter from the DVD content will be used to create sample clips.
        Choose a chapter that represents the typical content quality and style.
        Range: 1-999
    .PARAMETER ChapterDuration
        The duration of the chapter to extract in seconds. Default is 30. This determines
        how long the extracted sample clips will be.
        Longer durations provide better samples but require more storage space.
        Range: 1-3600 seconds
    .PARAMETER CaptionDirectory
        The output directory name for extracted captions. Default is "captions".
        This directory will contain all extracted subtitle and caption files in various
        formats for use in subsequent processing steps.
        The actual path will be: ./Title/Season XX/captions/
    .EXAMPLE
        # Process a TV series DVD with standard settings
        Invoke-DvdProcessing -Title "Breaking Bad" -Path "D:\DVD1,D:\DVD2" -FilePatterns "*.vob","*.m2ts" -Season 1 -TvDbSeriesUrl "https://thetvdb.com/series/breaking-bad"
        Creates the directory structure:
        ./Breaking Bad/Season 01/
        ├── clips/         # Extracted sample clips
        ├── captions/      # Extracted captions
        ├── HandBrake/     # For HandBrake conversion
        ├── Remux/         # For remuxing operations
        ├── Topaz/         # For Topaz Video AI
        └── Bonus/         # For bonus content
    .EXAMPLE
        # Process a movie with custom chapter extraction settings
        Invoke-DvdProcessing -Title "The Matrix" -Path "D:\Movie" -FilePatterns "*.vob" -Season 1 -TvDbSeriesUrl "https://thetvdb.com/series/the-matrix" -ChapterNumber 2 -ChapterDuration 45
        Extracts a 45-second clip from chapter 2 instead of the default chapter 3 with 30-second duration.
    .EXAMPLE
        # Process multiple DVD sources with various file types and custom directories
        Invoke-DvdProcessing -Title "Game of Thrones" -Path "D:\DVD1,D:\DVD2,D:\DVD3" -FilePatterns "*.vob","*.m2ts","*.mkv" -Season 2 -TvDbSeriesUrl "https://thetvdb.com/series/game-of-thrones" -ClipsDirectory "samples" -CaptionDirectory "subtitles"
        Processes Game of Thrones Season 2 from multiple DVD sources, handling various file
        formats and using custom directory names for clips and captions.
    .EXAMPLE
        # Process with specific file patterns for DVD rips
        Invoke-DvdProcessing -Title "The Office" -Path "C:\Rips" -FilePatterns "C4_*","B3_*" -Season 3 -TvDbSeriesUrl "https://thetvdb.com/series/the-office-us"
        Processes The Office Season 3 using specific naming patterns for DVD and Blu-ray rips.
    .EXAMPLE
        # Process without chapter extraction (only copy files and extract captions)
        Invoke-DvdProcessing -Title "Breaking Bad" -Path "D:\DVD1" -FilePatterns "*.vob" -Season 1 -TvDbSeriesUrl "https://thetvdb.com/series/breaking-bad" -SkipChapterExtraction
        Processes Breaking Bad Season 1, copying files and extracting captions but skipping chapter sample creation.
    .EXAMPLE
        # Process without caption extraction (only copy files and extract chapters)
        Invoke-DvdProcessing -Title "Game of Thrones" -Path "D:\DVD1,D:\DVD2" -FilePatterns "*.m2ts" -Season 2 -TvDbSeriesUrl "https://thetvdb.com/series/game-of-thrones" -SkipCaptionExtraction
